# Prime Number Challenge

This program prints to STDOUT a multiplication table of the first _n_ prime numbers (default is 10).

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and run the following from the project directory:

```
ruby prime_number_challenge.rb
```

If you prefer to use a different number of primes, pass in a variable at the end of the command:

```
ruby prime_number_challenge.rb 15
```

## Prerequisites

1. ruby
   - written in 2.6.3 but tested in 2.3.0, 2.4.0, 2.5.0 and 2.6.x

## Running the tests

The tests run automatically when the program is run. If the tests fail, the program will not
output the multiplication table.
